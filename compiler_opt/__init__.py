# (assuming the app's main uses directly or indirectly absl.app.main). However,
# when loaded in a test harness like pytest or unittest (e.g. python -m pytest)
# that won't happen.
# While tests shouldn't use the flags directly, some flags - like compilation
# timeout - have default values that need to be accessible.
# This makes sure flags are initialized, for this purpose.
